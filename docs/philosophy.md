# Philosophy

DiscoClaw is intentionally small.

- Favor a tiny, auditable codebase over a feature-rich gateway.
- Keep the boundary between Discord and model runtimes explicit.
- Prefer simple data files for state (`data/*.json`) over databases.
- Treat customization as code edits and clear configs, not a plugin ecosystem.

This repo is modeled after nanoclaw's direction: group-centric routing, minimal layers, and straightforward ops.
