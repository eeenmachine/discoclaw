# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

This file is for your specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:

- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Why Separate?

Your setup is yours. Keeping environment-specific notes here means you can update other files without losing your local config.

## Permissions

Your available tools are controlled by `PERMISSIONS.json` in this workspace.
If someone asks "what can you do?", check that file first — it defines your
access tier (`readonly`, `standard`, `full`, or `custom`).

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
